### Git & Github

Git
- SCM (Source Code Management) tool
- It is open source
- Developed and Maintained by Open Source community
- First curated by "Linus Torvalds" - Man behind linux kernel.
- Distributed Version Control System

GitHub
- Cloud Hosting Platform created for Projects that use Git
- Maintained by Microsoft 
- Microsoft acquired github in 2019 for 8 Billion Dollars.

What is a Version control System ?


A Version Control System (VCS) is a software tool that helps you track and manage changes to files over time. It's like a giant "undo/redo" button for your code, design files, documents, or any other digital asset. Here's what VCS offers:

1. Version History: VCS records every change made to a file, allowing you to revert to any previous version if needed. Imagine accidentally deleting a section of code â€“ with VCS, you can easily go back to any point in time and retrieve it.

2. Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously, with VCS ensuring everyone's changes are tracked and integrated seamlessly. No more confusion about who modified what and when.

3. Branching and Merging: VCS allows you to create different versions of your project (branches) to experiment with features or bug fixes without affecting the main branch. When satisfied, you can merge the changes back into the main branch.

4. Conflict Resolution: When multiple people modify the same file, VCS helps identify and resolve conflicts, ensuring smooth integration of changes.

5. Security and Auditing: VCS provides a security blanket by preventing accidental modifications and offering a complete history of who made changes when.

Common types of VCS:

**Centralized VCS:** Stores all versions in a central server (e.g., Subversion, GitLab).
**Distributed VCS:** Each user has a complete copy of the history locally (e.g., Git, Mercurial).


Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS):

Central Repository: All versions of the project are stored in a central server.
Single Access Point: Developers interact with the central server to commit changes, checkout files, and track history.
Branching: Branching and merging can be complex and require server interactions.
Offline Work: Limited or no offline capabilities, requiring constant server connection.
Examples: Subversion, Perforce, CVS
Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS):

Local Repository: Each developer has a complete copy of the repository on their local machine.
No Central Server (optional): Can operate without a central server, but often use one for collaboration.
Branching: Easy and lightweight branching and merging due to local copies.
Offline Work: Full functionality available offline, with changes pushed to the central server later.
Examples: Git, Mercurial, Bazaar
Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

|Feature|CVCS|DVCS|
|--|--|--|
|Repository	|Centralized server|	Distributed, local copy on each machine|
|Access Point|	Single server|	Local and optional central server|
|Branching|	Complex, server-dependent|	Easy and lightweight|
|Offline Work|	Limited	|Full functionality|
|Collaboration|	Server-centric|	More flexible|
|Examples|	Subversion, Perforce, CVS	| Git, Mercurial, Bazaar|
