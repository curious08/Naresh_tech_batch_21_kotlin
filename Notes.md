### onSaveInstanceState

When an activity is rotated (configuration change happens) from potrait to landscape and vice-versa, the activity restarts. That is the reason, we see that the UI gets reset. Hence, in the score keeper app, the score is getting reset.

This onSaveInstanceState() method is going to save the values during the configuration change or when the activity is about to be destroyed.
